Objects are a way of organizing code in a program and breaking things down to 
make it easier to think about complex ideas

Classes are a way of classifying things (objects) into groups and classes are what defines objects

We define classes using the class keyword followed by name (convention is first letter is capitalized)
e.g
class Things:
    pass

If a class is a part of another class, then it is called a child of that class and the other class is
its parent.
To tell Python that a class is part of another class, we put the name of the parent class in parantheses
after the name of our class
e.g
class Inanimate(Things):
    pass

class Mammals(Animals):
    pass

To create an object (also called instance of a class), we use the code snippet below
object_name = class_name()

We call the class name with parantheses at the end and assign it to a variable that will store it

To make objects more useful, we can describe characteristics of objects that belong to a class.
These characteristics can be thought of as actions, or functions â€” things that an object of that
class can do

When we define a function that is associated with a class, we do so in the same way that we define
any other function, except that we indent it beneath the class definition e.g

class Mammals(Animals):
    def feed_young_one_with_milk(self):
        pass

Class functions first parameter is self. The self parameter is a way for one function in the class
to call another function in the class (and in the parent class).
