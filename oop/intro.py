Objects are a way of organizing code in a program and breaking things down to 
make it easier to think about complex ideas

Classes are a way of classifying things (objects) into groups and classes are what defines objects

We define classes using the class keyword followed by name (convention is first letter is capitalized)
e.g
class Things:
    pass
''')
