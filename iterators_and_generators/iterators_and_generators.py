print(r'''
Iterables are objects that can return each of their elements one at a time e.g a list
Iterator is an object that represents a stream of data for example one returned by the enumerate function
An iterator is different from an iterable like a list since a list is not a stream of data

You can create iterators using generators
Generator - a function that creates an iterator
