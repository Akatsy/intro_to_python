We can import Python code from other scripts into our programs
If the Python file you want to import is in the same folder as your current script, you just type import followed by the name of the file without the .py extension
Import statements are written at the top of a Python script, each one on a separate line although Python will still run if they are included later in the script (Note: You are only able to access what you have imported after the import statement)
Having the import statement at the top of a file is nice as readers get to see what your script depends on before reading the rest of the code.
